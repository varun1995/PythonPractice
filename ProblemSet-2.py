Scenario: Merging Sorted Log Files

### Scenario: User Support Ticket Classifier

You‚Äôre building a backend tool that automatically classifies **customer support tickets** based on their issue descriptions.
The goal is to identify **distinctive keywords** that help categorize the ticket quickly.

To optimize keyword extraction, your system tries to find the **first non-repeating character** in the entire support
description string ‚Äî this helps eliminate generic or spammy entries that might be repeated often.

This character is used as an internal signal for identifying potential **unique identifiers** in short phrases or logs
submitted by users.

First non-repeating character: 'l'
