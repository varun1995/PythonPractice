# 🐍 Daily Python Practice – Real-World Problems

This repository is dedicated to tracking my daily Python practice sessions, where I solve 5 carefully selected problems each day, based on real-world use cases that reflect what a software engineer or QA automation engineer would encounter on the job.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

The goal is not just to solve dry algorithmic questions, but to:

- Practice **Python problem-solving** using **practical, contextual scenarios**
- Build strong understanding of **core Python concepts**
- Develop solutions that resemble how professionals think in real software projects
- Gradually prepare for real-world challenges and technical interviews

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Every day, I receive 5 questions via ChatGPT.
- Each question is framed around **real-world scenarios** (e.g., bug trackers, IoT pipelines, log processing, etc.).
- I solve these problems **without direct code help**, using:
  - Reasoning
  - Test data simulation
  - Edge case analysis
- I only ask for code help when absolutely needed (learning-first approach).
- Solutions, test data, and notes are versioned and pushed to this repository.

## 🧠 Topics Covered So Far

- String manipulation
- List filtering and transformations
- Regex for validation
- Dictionary counting and data aggregation
- Data sanitization and formatting
- Case handling and normalization
- Edge case handling and input validation
- Functional thinking with list comprehensions

## ✅ Commit Style

Each commit is made after a full day’s session and includes:

- The 5 questions solved
- Any reusable utilities/functions
- Test data used
- Comments or notes on learnings or challenges

---

## 🧭 Long-Term Goals

- Strengthen Python fluency for real-world applications
- Build a strong foundation for technical interviews
- Prepare for contributing to production-level Python codebases
- Eventually expand into data structures, algorithms, and test automation patterns

This is a personal growth project, but if you want to fork it or use the problem framing format, feel free to adapt it for your own learning.
